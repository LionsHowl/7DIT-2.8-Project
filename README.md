# 7DIT-2.8-Project

# Ghost Breach


### Propose
I made this game so that people could be entertained and enjoy themselves while playing it. I want people to try and beat their own high scores to better themselves rather than being compared to others via leaderboards. I also hope this helps people fight boredom when they have nothing else to do.

### Story
Oh no, there has been a ***"GHOST BREACH"*** and ghosts are escaping from the underworld to the human realm. Armed with a spellbook given to you by Hades when you became a Grim Reaper, you go out and fight the ghosts to send them back to the underworld.

### How To Open
To open the game, click the green <>code button, then press download zip. Once you have downloaded the zip file, open it and open project.godot in godot. Then you have two options:
- Press cmd + B(Mac) or CTRL + B(Windows)
- Or head to the top right of the window and click the play button.

### How to Play
W or Up Arrow - To move the Player up.

A or Left Arrow - To move the Player left.

S or Down Arrow - To move the Player down.

D or Right Arrow - To move the Player right.

The spellbook follows your mouse, and it casts spells automatically.
